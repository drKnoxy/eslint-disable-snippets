# eslint-disable-snippets

Includes snippets for ignoring; a block, the current line, or the next line.

1. Start typing `eslint-disable` in a javascript `.js`, javascriptreact `.jsx`, typescript `.ts`, typescriptreact `.tsx` or vue `.vue` file to trigger the snippet autocomplete.
1. Type the rule you want to disable or leave empty to disable all rules.
1. Press `tab` to drop your cursor at a helpful position.
1. Press `ctrl+↓`(win) `option+↓`(mac) to move the current line down. This is useful if you are wrapping a block of
   code.
